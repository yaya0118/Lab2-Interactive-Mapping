## Collaborations and reliance on other resources
In this choropleth map, I downloaded the US state data from the leaflet. From this small project, I learned how to create map elements. For example, how to set up information boxes, map legends, and map titles. In addition, set the layer, color and changes for each item to indicate the population density of the contour map. For this map, I added a disaster dataset that has recently occurred in the United States. I use a heat map model to illustrate the combination of disaster data and population density. I use the mouse to move the coding resources to demonstrate the population density (number of people per square mile) for each state in the information box.

## Reflective analysis

### Purpose, audience and thesis of the map
This map is designed for people who may be involved in the US population. In addition, disaster data indicates that recent disasters have occurred along coastlines, particularly in southern and southern California, Florida and California, with relatively high population densities. When the mouse moves from one place to another, population density statistics vary from state to state. However, the unsuccessful state name displayed on the map must be scaled up to a specific level, which may affect the reader's level of understanding in advance.

### Process in the design/iteration of the map
In order to make this map, I follow the normal map design process. The first important thing is to consider the map's thesis to interpret and search and select relevant data to display on the map. In addition, the coding program function is used to design or iterate the map. In addition, add information boxes, legends and other details to make the map clearer for the reader to understand.

### Map incorporate interactivity 
This map adds mouse movement to illustrate the US population density for each state. I added a information box to navigate the population density information.

### Data choice and cartographic stylings
A choropleth map is a thematic map in which the area is shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variables displayed on the map, such as population density. This type of map was chosen because the choropleth map is a basic map that the reader can easily understand the information or content.

### Ways to improve and relevant cartographic and interaction principles
This map can be improved in the coding program which use other functions to demonstrate different information such as the route from one state to another.
Interactive maps can be changed in some way through user actions - you can even rotate the globe or paste the pins in the wall map. In most cases, map navigation means panning and zooming by direct manipulation. If the map wants to support pan and zoom. I added the mouse movement feature and the floating tooltip should display the most important information in the info box.
